# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Together Assessments website built on the AstroWind template (Astro 5.0 + Tailwind CSS). This is a custom implementation for a neurodiversity assessment service provider.

## Reference Documentation

- **Template Examples**: Original AstroWind template examples are in `src/reference-examples/` for reference when building new components or understanding component usage patterns
- **Decap CMS Documentation**: Local documentation for Decap CMS is available in `decap-cms-docs/` for reference on CMS configuration and capabilities

## Language and Spelling

**IMPORTANT**: All content, code comments, documentation, and user-facing text should be written in **British English**. This includes:

- Spelling (e.g., "colour" not "color", "centre" not "center", "optimise" not "optimize")
- Vocabulary (e.g., "organisation" not "organization", "favourite" not "favorite")
- Date formats (DD/MM/YYYY)
- Any generated content or copy

## Sister Sites

The site is part of a network including:
- Together ADHD (https://togetheradhd.co.uk)
- Together Autism (https://togetherautism.co.uk)

## Essential Commands

### Development

```bash
npm run dev          # Starts BOTH Astro dev server AND CMS proxy server concurrently
npm run build        # Build production site to ./dist/
npm run preview      # Preview built site locally
```

**Note**: The `dev` command runs `concurrently "npx decap-server" "astro dev"` to enable local CMS editing at http://localhost:4321/admin/

### Code Quality

```bash
npm run check        # Run all checks (astro, eslint, prettier)
npm run fix          # Auto-fix ESLint and Prettier issues
npm run check:astro  # Check Astro files
npm run check:eslint # Check ESLint rules
npm run check:prettier # Check Prettier formatting
```

**IMPORTANT**: Always run `npm run fix` after making changes to automatically fix linting and formatting issues before committing.

## Component Reference Documentation

### CHEATSHEET.md - Complete Component Guide

The `CHEATSHEET.md` file in this repository is a comprehensive reference guide containing:

- **55 documented components** with usage examples and prop descriptions
- Complete code snippets showing how to import and use each component
- Detailed prop lists with types and default values
- Special notes about component behavior and requirements
- Common patterns and best practices

**How to use CHEATSHEET.md:**

1. **Finding components**: Search for component names to quickly find usage examples
2. **Understanding props**: Each component lists all available props with descriptions
3. **Copy-paste examples**: Code snippets are ready to use with minor modifications
4. **Component categories**:
   - Widget Components (22): Major page sections like Hero, Features, Pricing
   - UI Components (9): Basic building blocks like Button, Form, ItemGrid
   - Blog Components (10): Blog-specific like GridItem, Tags, Pagination
   - Common Components (11): Utilities like Image, Analytics, Metadata
   - Layouts (4): Page structure templates

**Quick component lookup example:**

- Need a hero section? Search "Hero" to find Hero, Hero2, and HeroText variants
- Building a form? Search "Form" or "Contact" for form components
- Adding features? Search "Features" for Features, Features2, and Features3 options

## Architecture & Key Files

### Configuration System

**Configuration Architecture**:

1. **src/config.yaml**: Framework-level configuration (AstroWind defaults)
   - Site metadata and SEO defaults
   - Blog system settings
   - Analytics configuration
   - UI theme settings

2. **Content configuration** - Organised hierarchically:
   - `src/content/site-settings.yaml`: Company information (name, email, ICO registration), logo settings, footer information
   - `src/content/home-page/content.yaml`: Homepage-specific content including hero section, CTAs, section titles, and how-it-works steps

3. **astro.config.ts**: Astro build configuration, integrations, and markdown plugins

4. **vendor/integration/**: Custom AstroWind integration that processes config.yaml and makes it available via virtual module `astrowind:config`

### Directory Structure

- **src/components/**: Reusable components organized by type
  - `widgets/`: Page sections (Header, Footer, Hero, Features, etc.)
  - `ui/`: UI primitives (Button, Form, Headline, etc.)
  - `blog/`: Blog-specific components
  - `common/`: Shared utilities (Analytics, Metadata, etc.)
- **src/layouts/**: Page layouts (Layout, PageLayout, MarkdownLayout, LandingLayout)
- **src/pages/**: Routes - each file creates a page route
  - `[...blog]/`: Dynamic blog routing with categories and tags
  - Various policy and legal pages
- **src/content/**: Content collections with CMS management
  - `config.ts`: Collection schemas and loaders
  - `site-settings.yaml`: Site-wide configuration
  - `site-settings/trust-badges/`: Professional accreditation badges
  - `home-page/content.yaml`: Homepage content configuration
  - `faqs-page/faq-items/`: FAQ content items
  - `services-page/services/`: Service descriptions
  - `post/`: Blog posts (currently empty, posts load from src/data/post/)
- **src/utils/**: Helper functions for blog, images, permalinks, frontmatter processing

### Key Technologies & Patterns

- **Astro 5.0**: Static site generation with optional SSR support
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS with dark mode support
- **TypeScript**: Strict null checks enabled, path alias `~/*` maps to `src/*`
- **Content Collections**: Blog posts managed via Astro's content collections API
- **Image Optimization**: Uses Astro Assets and Unpic for CDN optimization
- **Markdown Processing**: Custom remark/rehype plugins for reading time, responsive tables, and lazy images

### Import Resolution

- Use `~/*` path alias for imports from src directory (e.g., `import Logo from '~/components/Logo.astro'`)
- Virtual module `astrowind:config` provides access to parsed configuration

### Content Collections

The site uses Astro Content Collections for structured content management:

#### Blog Posts (`post`)
- Location: `src/data/post/` (loaded via glob loader)
- Schema: publishDate, title, excerpt, image, category, tags, author, metadata
- Dynamic routing with categories, tags, and pagination
- RSS feed generation at `/rss.xml`

#### FAQs (`faqs_page_items`)
- Location: `src/content/faqs-page/faq-items/`
- Schema: question, answer, order, published
- Used on homepage (first 4) and FAQ page (all)
- Managed via CMS under "FAQs Page / FAQ Items"

#### Services (`services_page_items`)
- Location: `src/content/services-page/services/`
- Schema: title, description, anchor, order, icon, published
- Displayed on homepage and linked to service page sections
- Managed via CMS under "Services Page / Service Items"

#### Trust Badges (`site_settings_trust_badges`)
- Location: `src/content/site-settings/trust-badges/`
- Schema: name, display_text, logo_light, logo_dark, alt, order, published
- Professional accreditations displayed on homepage
- Managed via CMS under "Site Settings / Trust Badges"

### Blog System

- Posts stored in `src/data/post/` as .md or .mdx files
- Dynamic routing handles categories, tags, and pagination
- RSS feed generation at `/rss.xml`
- Related posts widget configured in config.yaml

### Styling Approach

- Custom styles in `src/components/CustomStyles.astro` and `src/assets/styles/tailwind.css`
- Follow existing Tailwind utility patterns
- Dark mode toggle controlled via `ui.theme` in config.yaml

### Build Output

- Static HTML generation by default (`output: 'static'`)
- Supports hybrid and server modes, but blog requires `prerender = true`
- Build artifacts output to `dist/` directory

### Deployment Configuration

**IMPORTANT**: The site configuration is controlled by `src/config.yaml` which OVERRIDES `astro.config.ts` settings.

**Current Deployment** (Netlify):

- Site: `https://nd-assessment-site.netlify.app`
- Base path: `/`
- Auto-deploys from `main` branch

**To Switch to Custom Domain** (future):

1. In Netlify: Domain settings â†’ Add custom domain
2. Update `src/config.yaml`:

```yaml
site:
  site: 'https://yourcustomdomain.com'
  base: '/'
```

3. Update `public/admin/config.yml`:

```yaml
site_url: https://yourcustomdomain.com
display_url: https://yourcustomdomain.com
```

## Content Management System (CMS)

### Overview

Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is configured for content management with GitHub-based storage and Editorial Workflow for controlled publishing.

### Local Development

1. Run `npm run dev` - automatically starts:
   - Astro dev server at http://localhost:4321
   - Decap CMS proxy server for local editing
2. Access CMS at http://localhost:4321/admin/
3. No authentication required for local editing
4. Changes are saved directly to local files
5. All content collections are editable locally

### Production Editing

1. Access CMS at https://yoursite.com/admin/
2. Authenticate with GitHub (uses repository permissions)
3. Editorial Workflow stages:
   - **Draft**: Initial content creation, image uploads held in branch
   - **In Review**: Creates Pull Request for review
   - **Ready**: Content approved and ready to publish
   - **Published**: Merges PR to main branch, triggers single build

### Image Management

- Images uploaded via CMS are stored in `src/assets/images/`
- Automatic optimization occurs at build time:
  - Multiple responsive sizes (640px to 6016px)
  - WebP format conversion for better compression
  - Proper srcset/sizes attributes for responsive loading
- Images referenced in content use `~/assets/images/` path
- Only committed when content is published (prevents orphaned images)

### CMS Configuration

- **Config Location**: `public/admin/config.yml`
- **Backend**: GitHub with Editorial Workflow
- **Collections** - Organised hierarchically in the CMS UI:
  - **Site Settings**: General configuration and trust badges
  - **Home Page**: Homepage content management
  - **FAQs Page / FAQ Items**: Frequently asked questions
  - **Services Page / Service Items**: Service offerings
  - **Blog Posts**: Blog content
- **Media**: Git-based storage in `src/assets/images/` with Astro optimisation pipeline

### Authentication Setup

- **Current Setup**: Hosted on Netlify - OAuth works automatically
- **No additional configuration needed** - Netlify handles GitHub authentication
- **Just works** - Login with GitHub at `/admin/`

### Benefits of Editorial Workflow

1. **No Race Conditions**: Single build per publish, not per edit
2. **No Orphaned Images**: Images only committed when published
3. **Review Process**: Preview changes before going live
4. **Version Control**: Full Git history with meaningful commit messages
5. **Rollback**: Easy reversion through Git if needed

### Content Organisation Strategy

The CMS uses a hierarchical naming convention to group related content:
- **File Collections**: Used for single configuration files (Site Settings, Home Page)
- **Folder Collections**: Used for multiple items (FAQ Items, Service Items, Trust Badges)
- **Naming Convention**: Uses "/" in labels to create logical groupings in the CMS UI
- **Collection Names**: Use underscores in technical names (e.g., `faqs_page_items`) for Astro compatibility

### Adding New Content Types

To add new collections:
1. Edit `public/admin/config.yml` following the hierarchical naming pattern
2. Create corresponding content directories under `src/content/`
3. Update `src/content/config.ts` with the collection schema
4. Import collections in pages using `getCollection('collection_name')`
