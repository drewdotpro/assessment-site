This document describes the Together Assessments website structure: what pages exist, what can be configured, and where to find content settings. This is a structural/architectural guide - it describes WHAT can be set and WHERE, not the current content values themselves.

For technical implementation details and development workflows, see [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md).

**Scope**: This document describes site structure and content organisation from a content editor's perspective. For technical implementation details, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md). For CMS workflows, see [CMS.md](./CMS.md).

### CMS Configuration

#### Multi-Site Configuration System

This project supports **three separate websites** from a single codebase:

- Together Assessments (assessments)
- Together ADHD (adhd)
- Together Autism (autism)

The CMS configuration is **generated at build time** based on which site is being built.

**Template File (SOURCE):**

- **File:** `public/admin/config.template.yml`
- **Purpose:** Single source of truth for ALL CMS configuration across all three sites
- **Important:** Edit THIS file to modify CMS configuration
- **Placeholders:**
  - `{{WEBSITE_ID}}` - Replaced with: assessments, adhd, or autism
  - `{{MEDIA_FOLDER}}` - Replaced with: `src/assets/images/{siteId}`
  - `{{PUBLIC_FOLDER}}` - Replaced with: `~/assets/images/{siteId}`
  - `{{SITE_URL}}` - Replaced with site-specific URL

**Generated Configuration File:**

- **File:** `public/admin/config.yml`
- **Purpose:** Auto-generated, site-specific CMS configuration
- **Important:** ⚠️ **DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE** - It's regenerated on every dev/build
- **Status:** Added to `.gitignore` (not version controlled)
- **Generated by:** `scripts/generate-cms-config.js`

**How Configuration Generation Works:**

1. Developer runs site-specific command (e.g., `npm run dev:assessments`)
2. Pre-hook calls `scripts/generate-cms-config.js` with `WEBSITE_ID` environment variable
3. Script reads `config.template.yml`
4. Script replaces placeholders with site-specific values
5. Script writes to `config.yml`
6. CMS loads the site-specific configuration

**Site-Specific Content Separation:**

- **Assessments:** `src/content/assessments/*`, `src/assets/images/assessments/`
- **ADHD:** `src/content/adhd/*`, `src/assets/images/adhd/`
- **Autism:** `src/content/autism/*`, `src/assets/images/autism/`

Each site's content is completely isolated - no cross-contamination between sites.

#### CMS Settings

Controls Decap CMS behaviour:

- GitHub repository connection
- Branch configuration
- Editorial workflow settings
- Media folder locations (site-specific)
- Collection definitions and schemas
- Custom widget configurations

**Key Settings (site-specific examples):**

For assessments site:

- Media folder: `src/assets/images/assessments/`
- Public folder reference: `~/assets/images/assessments/`
- Content location: `src/content/assessments/`
- Site URL for previews: (set via environment variables)
- Commit message templates (include site ID)

For adhd/autism sites: Similar structure with their respective site IDs.

---

### Custom Styles

**File:** `src/components/CustomStyles.astro`

Contains global style definitions:

- CSS custom properties (CSS variables)
- Font definitions and preloading
- Colour theming (primary, secondary, accent)
- Dark mode styles
- Neurodiversity-friendly font configurations

**Fonts Defined:**

- Sylexiad Sans Medium (default body/serif)
- OpenDyslexic3 (dyslexia-friendly)
- Fast Sans (fast-reading alternative)
- Together Assessments (brand heading font)

---

## Navigation

Navigation is configured in `src/navigation.ts` with responsive breakpoint support and dynamic booking links.

### Dynamic Booking Links

The navigation system responds to the **Waitlist Only Mode** toggle in Site Settings:

- **When `waitlist_only: false` (default):**
  - All booking links say "Book a Consultation" and link to `/consultation`

- **When `waitlist_only: true`:**
  - All booking links say "Join the Waitlist" and link to `/waitlist`

This affects:

- Header button (desktop xl+ and tablet/mobile)
- Tablet menu "Assessments" dropdown
- Footer "Pages" section

**Implementation:** `src/navigation.ts` lines 53-55 create `bookingLink` and `bookingText` variables based on `settings.site.waitlist_only` flag.

### Desktop Navigation

Displayed at `xl:` breakpoint and above (1280px+):

- About
- Services
- Fees
- FAQs

  - Contact
  - Self-Help
  - Local Support
  - Blog
- Together (dropdown):
  - Together ADHD (external link)
  - Together Autism (external link)
- **Dynamic booking button** in header (text and link respond to Waitlist Only Mode)

### Tablet Navigation

- Resources (dropdown):

## Accessibility Features

**Note:** For complete accessibility documentation including WCAG compliance and testing procedures, see [ACCESSIBILITY.md](./ACCESSIBILITY.md).

### Neurodiversity-Friendly Fonts

The site implements a custom font switcher allowing users to select their preferred reading font:

**Available Fonts:**

2. **OpenDyslexic3** - Specifically designed for dyslexic readers
3. **Fast Sans** - Optimised for quick reading and reduced eye strain
4. **Together Assessments** - Brand font used for headings only

**Implementation:**

- Font switcher dropdown in header
- User preference saved to localStorage
- Fonts preloaded for performance
- Consistent metrics across all fonts (size-adjust)

**Technical Details:**

- Font definitions: `src/components/CustomStyles.astro`
- Font switcher: `src/components/common/ToggleFont.astro`
- Font files: `public/fonts/`

These are linked in the navigation under the "Together" dropdown menu.

---

## Additional Notes

### Content Philosophy

This documentation describes the **structure** of the website (what CAN be configured), not the **content** (what IS currently configured). This separation allows:

- Understanding where to make changes without needing to know current values
- Maintaining consistency as content evolves
- Clear documentation for new team members or future reference

### Image Management

- All images uploaded via CMS are stored in site-specific folders:
  - Assessments: `src/assets/images/assessments/`
  - ADHD: `src/assets/images/adhd/`
  - Autism: `src/assets/images/autism/`
- Images are automatically optimised during build (multiple sizes, WebP conversion)
- Editorial Workflow prevents orphaned images (images only committed when content is published)
- Maximum file sizes enforced by CMS for different image types
- Each site's images are completely separate (no cross-contamination)

### Editorial Workflow

The CMS uses Editorial Workflow with three stages:

1. **Draft** - Initial content creation
2. **In Review** - Creates Pull Request for review
3. **Ready** - Approved and ready to publish
4. **Published** - Merged to main branch, triggers build

This prevents race conditions and ensures quality control before content goes live.
